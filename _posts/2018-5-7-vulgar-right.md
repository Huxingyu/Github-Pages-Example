Last month,a chinese start-up had trouble,because "drawing the ire of china's censors".Of course,this move by the goverment also drawed the ire of china's people.

China's top madia regulator closed this app--Neihan Duanzi,was shut down for hosting "vulgar" jokes and videos."Caused strong dislike among internet uers",a brief notice from the State Administration of Radio and Television said.

This incident involves many aspects,closely related to the laws of operation of this country today.We cannot simply make a conclusion about it,right or wrong,like this adjective is not suitable for its attributive.This is a occurrence in this time,we only can make a understanding about it.

In this article,i must say i have't a clear thinking,this why i said we can't make a simply conclusion.I want to talk about the position and role of this incident's participants,include the country's govement and the application's user.

If there are some things that happen by no menas accidental,then i think this drama is in it.

Considering that china is tightening its power step by step,and the rulers strongly hope for the stability of society,it is not the right time to Neihan Duanzi's appear.

There are many saying about why Neihan Duanzi's bloked,and there is a saying called formation of an organization,i don't agree with it.I think it has put the incident in a very sensitive position and turned it into a black or white problem.

My answer to this question:it widely involved in vulgar content,and the spread is too broad,not conducive to the healthy development of society.It sounds like a shit like offcial speech,but i think it's ture.

In the utopian novels of the last century, they all mentioned that in a highly centralized society, rulers always advocate strict purity and goodness,mixed with a frigidity style.
